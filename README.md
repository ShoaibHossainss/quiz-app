- Timer: Each question has a 30-second timer. If the user doesn't select an answer in time, the question automatically moves to the next one.
- Answer Submission: Users can select their answer for multiple-choice questions or type in their answer for integer-based questions. The app checks the answer against the correct one and updates the score accordingly.
- Quiz Completion: When all questions are answered, the user's score is displayed, and the results are saved in IndexedDB. The user also receives an alert with their score.
